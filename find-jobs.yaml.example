prompt: |
  I am a Senior Software Engineer.
  Attached is my Resume and a list of {job_count} recent job postings.

  TASK:
  Identify the jobs that match my profile with a score of 90/100 or higher.

  STRICT FILTERING CRITERIA:
  1. MUST involve Python, Go, or systems programming.
  2. MUST be backend, infrastructure, or platform engineering.
  3. REJECT all Frontend, React, or Web Design roles.
  4. REJECT all staffing agencies.

  Return the results in descending order by score.

  If JSON output is selected below, return a JSON array where each object has:
    - "position": Position Name
    - "company": Company Name
    - "score": Match Score (integer)
    - "reason": Why it fits
    - "short_description": A summary of the position information provided in the listing
    - "link": Application URL

  If markdown output is selected below, explicitly specify the following information
  for each position:
    * Position Name
    * Company
    * Match Score
    * Why it fits
    * Short Description (a summary of the position information provided in the position listing)
    * Link

  If markdown output is selected below, then group the results by position. The markdown for
  each position should have the company name dash position name as the title, then
  beneath that header it would have the remaining information, and then a margin or gap
  before the next position.

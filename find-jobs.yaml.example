# EXCLUSION FILTERS (apply even if technologies are on your resume)
# =============================================================================
# Use these to filter out jobs you DON'T want, even if you have the skills.
# These are enforced both locally (pre-filter) and in the LLM prompt.

# Technologies to AVOID - jobs requiring these will be excluded
# Example: You know React but want backend-only roles
exclude_technologies:
  # - React
  # - TypeScript
  # - Angular
  # - Vue

# Role types to AVOID - matched against job titles (case-insensitive)
# Example: You want pure backend, not full-stack
exclude_role_types:
  # - Full-Stack
  # - Full Stack
  # - Frontend
  # - Front-End

# Keywords in job descriptions that should trigger exclusion
exclude_keywords:
  # - "React-first"
  # - "frontend-focused"

# Path to your resume/CV. Supports .txt, .md, or .docx.
# If omitted, you must supply --resume at runtime.
# Use forward slashes or escape backslashes in Windows paths.
resume_file: "resume.docx"

# REQUIRED: Prompt instructions sent to the LLM before appending your resume + job list.
# Available placeholders:
#   {job_count} - number of jobs being evaluated
#   {exclusion_rules} - auto-generated from exclude_* lists above

  TASK:
  Identify the jobs that match my profile with a score of 90/100 or higher.

  STRICT FILTERING CRITERIA:
  1. MUST involve Python, Go, or systems programming.
  2. MUST be backend, infrastructure, or platform engineering.
  3. REJECT all staffing agencies.

  Return the results in descending order by score.

  If JSON output is selected below, return a JSON array where each object has:
    - "position": Position Name
    - "company": Company Name
    - "score": Match Score (integer)
    - "reason": Why it fits
    - "short_description": A summary of the position information provided in the listing
    - "link": Application URL

  If markdown output is selected below, explicitly specify the following information
  for each position:
    * Position Name
    * Company
    * Match Score
    * Why it fits
    * Short Description (a summary of the position information provided in the position listing)
    * Link

  If markdown output is selected below, then group the results by position. The markdown for
  each position should have the company name dash position name as the title, then
  beneath that header it would have the remaining information, and then a margin or gap
  before the next position.

  In your response, include only the selected output information either as markdown or json,
  as specified below.
